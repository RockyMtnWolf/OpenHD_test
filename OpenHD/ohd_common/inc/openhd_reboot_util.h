// TODO
// dirty
// OpenHD is written under the assumption that once discovered hardware works
// and does not disconnect / their linux driver(s) doesn't crash. Most common
// camera driver error(s) are handled gracefully, e.g. restarting the pipeline
// seems to fix most issues with the rpi camera drivers. For the wifi cards, it
// is a bit more complicated though. Here are the 2 most common issues - they
// are always fixable by using proper hardware, but we have the following checks
// in place anyways to account for the common mistake of improper wiring. 1)
// completely disconnecting and then reconnecting the wifi card
// -> can be fixed semi-gracefully by just crashing openhd, then letting the
// service re-start openhd 2) crashed / messed up wifi (driver ?!)
// -> requires a complete re-boot of linux
