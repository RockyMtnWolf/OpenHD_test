 * Special, for communicating with QGroundControl.. / QOpenHD (any common
 * mavlink based QGC application) Quick: QGroundControl wants a TCP-like
 * communication - even in UDP if it receives data from a UDP sender::port
 * tuple, the responses are sent there,too. This actually makes sense, it is
 * just different to how EZ-WB / OpenHD used to do telemetry forwarding all the
 * time. But it means that we have to listen and send from the same UDP port.
