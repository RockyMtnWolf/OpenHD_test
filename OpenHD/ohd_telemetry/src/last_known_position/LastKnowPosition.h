/**
 * This class exposes the following simple functionality:
 * Have a file on the disc that contains the X last known positions of the UAV
 * Needs to be updated by listening for MAVLINK_MSG_ID_GLOBAL_POSITION_INT
 * messages Writing to the disk happens max. 1 time per second and is decoupled
 * in an extra thread - this way, we reduce the file writes AND are guaranteed
 * data is written after a specific amount of time even if the "on_new_position"
 * is not called anymore by the telemetry parsing thread.
