 * This class nicely hides away all the (nasty) reading of the onboard computer
 * status (clock speed, temperature,..) A status can be queried any time,
 * basically atomically.
 *
 * More info:
 * We need one thread for the CPU usage (workaround) and
 * for some reason, running all those vcgencmd's on rpi for figuring out the
 * current clock speed can also block for a significant amount of time
 * (significant enough that it is a bad idea to call them from the "main"
 * telemetry thread. This class decouples these data generation steps from the
 * main telemetry thread. We do not care about latency at all on these
 * statistics, so we can easily do those stats using a producer / consumer
 * pattern
