 * USB hotspot (USB Tethering).

 * Tethering on on his phone/tablet) we don't need any settings or similar, and
 * checking once every second barely uses any CPU resources. This was created by
 * translating the tether_functions.sh script from wifibroadcast-scripts into
 * c++. This class configures and forwards the connect and disconnect event(s)
 * for a USB tethering device, such that we can start/stop forwarding to the
 * device's ip address. Only supports one USB tethering device connected at the
 * same time. Also, assumes that the usb tethering device always shows up under
 * /sys/class/net/usb0. Note that we do not have to perform any setup action(s)
 * here - network manager does that for us We really only listen to the event's
 * device connected / device disconnected and forward them.
